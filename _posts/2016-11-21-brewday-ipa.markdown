I have been starting to brew my own beer this year. After travelling New Zealand for quite some time, I finally realised that beer is awesome. NZ is full of micro-breweries and awesome beers. Thank you!

### BIAB

Thanks to a nice british fella we met in Wellington I learned about __Brew In A Bag (BIAB)__. Basically you mash in a bag, so you can skip the lautering and just take the bag out after your mashing is done. There are plenty of brewing instructions as well as BIAB instruction online, so I won't get into detail here.

### Todays recipe
Today I am brewing an IPA recipe with _Perle_, _Cascade_ and _Amarillo Gold_ hops. But, I don't have _Cascade_ and _Amarillo Gold_, so I will substitute those with _Motueka_ hops. Good old New Zealand style ...
