I was extremely stunned by the sheer beauty of [Hexinverters Orbitals](http://www.hexinverter.net/orbitals/) step-sequencer. The led-push-buttons, the whole layout. I could not resist building a unit for myself. As it is quite big (42hp) I decided to gift it with its own home and made a truely homemade panel for it.

Building the module itself was pretty much straight forward, thanks to the [great build-guide](data.hexinverter.net/ORBITALS_AssemblyManual_v1.03.pdf). The interesting part was building the case and doing the frontpanel. I built two cases, because I was not happy with the first one (from plexiglas). The second one is wooden (I spraypainted the front and the back).

The panel (I had a blank 42hp lying around, came with my case back in the days) is handdrilled with my drill press and then spraypainted. I used [Letraset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letraset) for labeling the panel. I do love the vintagy-used look it got from that!

Last but not least I had to add an extra power-supply, since I wanted the sequencer to be independent from the rest of my setup. I build it on stripboard using [this layout (scroll down to post 12)](http://electro-music.com/forum/topic-35373.html&postorder=asc).
