After finishing the [new veggie bed]({% post_url 2014-05-23-veggie-bed %}) for our terrace it was also time to build a new table. We build this from all used / thrown out wood, that I collected at a construction site a while ago.

Very solid construction, that should last for a couple of years, even considering mean old greyish shitty Berlin winters ...
