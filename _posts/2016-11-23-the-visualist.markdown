After building quite a lot of audio circuits and projects I finally finished my first visual synth project: [the Visualist](http://makezine.com/projects/visualist-70s-video-effects/).

This was quite an intensive project, since there is not really a BOM and some of the parts were quite hard to find. I finally managed to get all the parts though and the thing is a plain beauty. Everything you send in there, just becomes pretty ...

I did not build the audio-circuit because I wanted the box to have CV ins instead. So now I can actually sync the box to my modular. That is awesome, I will post a video here very soon!
