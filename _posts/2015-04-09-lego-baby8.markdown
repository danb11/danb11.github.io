Another SDIY classic: the baby8. This has been build by so many people in various forms, so I won't go too much into detail. I used this [stripboard-layout](http://electro-music.com/forum/topic-52774.html) to fire it up.

I had already build one of these before in a wooden case, so I wanted to spice this one up a little. Thus I added the following features:

<div marked>
  - adjustable gate-length (most info is in [here](http://www.sequencer.de/synthesizer/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=94971) _german only, sorry_). Essentially I used [this circuit](/assets/images/2015-lego-baby8/gate2trig.jpg) _thanks a lot to elektrouwe!_
  - external clock in (just insert it between the "onboard-clock" with a switchable-jack)
  - external reset in, check from [fonitroniks schematics](http://modular.fonik.de/pdf/baby10.pdf) for details
</div>

It runs on a 9V battery. So its a nice little autonomous maschine.
