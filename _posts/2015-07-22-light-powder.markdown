This is a classic [40106 DIY drone synth](http://fluxmonkey.com/electronoize/40106Oscillator.htm) build into an unusual case. I found this old baby-powder-case with all these little holes in the top and figured this would be awesome for a light-responsive synth.

Instead of pots I used [LDRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) to vary the resistance depending on brightness. Thats basically the whole trick :)

There is a nice video of it here:
