I always loved playing with Lego when I was a child. Some time ago I moved and I just had this incredibly ugly desk (I bought it as a last resort when I started studying for 10â‚¬ from a weird used furniture shop down at my street).

I was quite keen to pimp the desk a bit and being [inspired](http://inhabitat.com/amazing-lego-table-would-make-even-the-most-boring-meeting-fun/) to built stuff with Lego.

I bought an old glass-desk and cut my old desk so that it would sit within the Lego and started building ...

It take way more stones then I thought ... I think about 4000
