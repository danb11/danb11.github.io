Korg's Monotrons are a great toy. Especially because they were obviously build modding friendly. I modded both this Monotron and a [Monotron Delay]({% post_url 2015-06-01-monotron-delay %}). Both toys were turned into an awesome, but still not to serious synthesizer.

### The feature list
<div marked>
- replaced all the fiddly pots with normal sized ones
- replaced Monotrons toggle switch (off - pitch - cutoff) with a new switch
- added patchpoints for CV, cutoff frequency, gate and external in (check [dinsync](http://www.dinsync.info/2010/06/how-to-modify-korg-monotron.html))
- added switch to choose between LFO mode between one-shot EG and LFO (check [houshu](http://houshu.at.webry.info/201006/article_3.html))
- added feedback, the output going back to the input through a simple diode
- removed R11 to avoid the gate voltage affecting the pitch. Also puts Monotron in “Drone-Mode”
- switch to turn VCO off (check [houshu](http://houshu.at.webry.info/201006/article_4.html))
