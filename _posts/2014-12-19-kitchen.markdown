Our flat had this really old, crappy built-in kitchen. I'm pretty sure it was even cheaper than IKEA ... it was also falling apart. Literally. 2 doors had already fallen off ... So my flatmates and I decided to build a new one (the other option would have been to get an equally shitty new ktichen from the landlord).

Googling around I found this awesome guy way out of Berlin who's selling actual planks with bark and everything. Just a trunk sliced up. So we bought quite a lot of finest larch-wood and started building. Sorry for not taking pictures during the process. We were too busy planning / building ...

## Pictures of the old kitchen
I just found some pictures of the old kitchen. Just so you get an idea. I took them to convince the landlord that the kitchen is no good no more :)
