My first ***all inclusive***-project is finished. I created a PCB and a case for this little circuit done by [Jacob Watters](http://www.jacobwatters.com/blog/um-tss-drum-machine/). Thanks a lot for letting me use your circuit!

한글 폰트도 잘 나옵니다! 커밋테스트

I published the current project status as an Open Hardware Project on [github](https://github.com/tommueller/UM-TSS).
