My first ***all inclusive***-project is finished. I created a PCB and a case for this little circuit done by [Jacob Watters](http://www.jacobwatters.com/blog/um-tss-drum-machine/). Thanks a lot for letting me use your circuit!

한글을 한번 추가해볼까요? 한글이 나왔으면좋겠어요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

I published the current project status as an Open Hardware Project on [github](https://github.com/tommueller/UM-TSS).
